# A Numpad or Keypad
## Do as you please with it

It has:
- 16 standard 1:1 aspect ratio keys
- A 1:2 aspect ratio key
- Rotary Encoder
- Seeed Studio Xiao RP2040

The order of assembly/soldering is:
- The Diodes
- The Seeed Studio Xiao RP2040
- The Rotary Encoder
- Keys
- Keycaps Encoder Knob

This is yet to have firmware made for it as it is easier to debug with the actual hardware on hand.
Will be using either **KMK** or **QMK** most likely (kmk due to being easier to learn) and will be referencing [this](https://github.com/Acidicts/Hackpad)

The Rotary Encoder can be used as an audio knob all the way to being a selector for presets for different key setups.

Here is a render of the finished product:
