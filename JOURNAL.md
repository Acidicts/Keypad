## 10/20/2025 - Created the Schematic for the Keypad  

Made the schematic key arrangement is 4 columns by 5 rows:
- K = Key 
- E = Rotary Encoder
- 2K = 2 tall key 1x2 size top and bottom will be written out

K K K E
K K K K
K K K K
K K K 2K

## 10/21/2025 10:46 PM - Routed PCB  

I routed the pcb and removed a key to make space for the Xiao Seed Studio on the board. So the board has 4 columns with 5 rows with a total of 17 Keys and an rotary encoder

## 10/21/2025 10:49 PM - Made a Board Render  

I added a margin and made a render of the pcb to get an idea of what the shape of it will be and to start thinking if I want a case or enjoy the pcb in all its glory.

## 10/21/2025 11 PM - Complied with DRC rules  

I selected ignore all for the clearance drc rules as it was due to using a smaller diode size which brought two wires / tracks too close to each other causing the errors.

## 10/22/2025 11:09 PM - PCB Case  

Made Case for the keypad and tried getting the pcb into jlcpcb but failed, due to kicad exporting BOM and CPL wrong, and I couldn't find a diode for the 203_603metric footprint

## 10/22/2025 11:47 PM - Looking for parts  

PCb and diodes have been found but currently looking for keyswitches and keys to put on the board and yet to look for the seeed studio xiao rp2040 microcontroller

## 10/23/2025 5:03 PM - Found Keys and MCU  

I found the remaining components I need to buy: which are the seeed studio xiao rp2040, rotary encoder and key switches. The Case and keycaps will be 3D printed.

## 10/23/2025 5:33 PM - Organised a BOM for total price for all items  

I organised the items to show the usd prices for anything is gbp instead and organise the raw item prices vs shipping costs. This helps understand the costs for reviewers
